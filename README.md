## 🧩 Overview

This project is a **prototype workflow** that automatically handles any request submitted through a company’s contact page.  
It uses **React**, **Google Sheets**, and multiple **integrations (Discord, Slack, Gmail)** to update request status, notify relevant departments, and keep customers informed in real time.

The workflow ensures:
- Every request is logged automatically  
- The right department is notified instantly  
- Status updates are tracked and emailed automatically  
- The customer is updated at every stage

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Automatic Request Logging** — Every form submission is saved directly to Google Sheets  
✅ **AI-Generated Summary & Priority** — Gemini AI analyzes the message and assigns a summary and priority level  
✅ **Instant Notifications** — Request details are sent to the correct **Discord** and **Slack** department channels  
✅ **Email Automation** — Sends confirmation and update emails to both customer and developer  
✅ **Status Tracking** — Status can be changed to *“Ongoing”* or *“Resolved”*, updating everywhere in real time

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🖥️ Step 1 — Frontend (React)
- The user fills out a simple React form:
  - Select **Department** (e.g., HR, Support, IT)
  - Select **Request Type**
  - Enter **Message**
- When submitted, the workflow triggers automatically.

### ⚙️ Step 2 — Workflow Trigger
- The workflow takes around **30 seconds** to complete.
- It stores all request data in **Google Sheets**, including:
  - Department  
  - Request ID  
  - Message Summary (generated by Gemini AI)  
  - Priority  
  - Current Status  

### 🧾 Step 3 — Notifications
- The request is automatically sent to:
  - 🧩 **Discord Department Channel**
  - 💬 **Slack Department Channel**
- Email updates are sent to:
  - 📩 **Customer** — confirming that their request was received  
  - 👨‍💻 **Developer** — to review and take action  

### 🔁 Step 4 — Status Updates
- The developer can change the request status directly:
  - **Mark as Ongoing** → Customer receives “Your request is being resolved” email  
  - **Mark as Resolved** → Customer receives “Your request has been resolved successfully” email  

- The status in Google Sheets updates automatically with every change.
